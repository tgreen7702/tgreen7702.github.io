**What problems do you encounter when dealing with the dataset?**

There are no values for Tondu around the category of 7.5. Tondu referes to an attitude toward unification with mainland China.

**How to deal with missing values?**

We can drop observations with missing values or we can try to impute them (example:Â average imputation or common point imputation).

**Explore the relationship between Tondu and other variables including female, DPP, age, income, edu, Taiwanese and Econ_worse. What methods would you use?**

For numerical variables such as age, income and years of education, we can correlate them with Tondu or use scatterplots and a linear regression modeling. For categorical variables such as gender, DPP and Taiwanese in relationship to Tondu, we can use a bar plot.

**How about the votetsai variable (vote for DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen)?**

Since votetsai is dychotomous, we can assume it to be a dependent variable, we can then use logit to analyze the effect of Tondu on whether a voter votes for Tsai Ing-wen or not.
